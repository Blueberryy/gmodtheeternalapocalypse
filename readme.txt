-- I'm not sure about this --
You are free to make copy of it as long as you give credit to me and the original creator.
You can suggest anything, with the exception of functions that are too advanced.
I'm not really a very good at gmod lua. (Current level: Apprentice (in my opinion))

!! IMPORTANT !!

If you are making custom content or editing the gamemode, please change the text in languages file.
If you are adding something new, i won't bother with it.
Please, do NOT make some features needed to be paid for real money, a.ka donation.
I do not like servers that are very Pay-To-Win.
