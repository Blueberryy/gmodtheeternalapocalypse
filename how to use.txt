How does this work? It's simple: Place The Eternal Apocalypse into your gamemodes folder (garrysmod/gamemodes)
Also need to rename entire file into theeternalapocalypse


You will need to install these addons otherwise you'll get errors, missing sounds or some items won't work:

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=411284648 (gamemode content pack, basically just contains zombie models and suchlike)
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=448170926 (gamemode sweps pack)
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=128093075 (m9k small arms pack)
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=128089118 (m9k assault rifles)
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=128091208 (m9k heavy weapons)
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2438451886 (S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Item Models Pack)
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=355101935 (Stalker playermodels)

WARNING: IF YOU ARE USING THE DEFAULT SWEPS PACK YOU WILL ABSOLUTELY NEED TO HAVE M9K SMALL ARMS, ASSAULT RIFLES AND HEAVY WEAPONS INSTALLED
A lot of the default sweps use models and sounds from the m9k pack and will be errors if you dont have m9k installed on your server
and damn there are some weapons bugged which use some sounds from after the end content
M9k specialties is not required.

You can edit some things.
For example, death sound effect in server/server_util.lua
Prestige level requirement


===================================================================================

This gamemode requires three things:

1. Your map must have a navmesh as the zombies are nextbots (google gmod navmesh if you dont know what this is or how to make one)
(or just do nav_generate, if it can't generate, simply enable sv_cheats then give entity info_player_start to yourself at place you want
to generate navmesh then do nav_generate [you can also use Navmesh tool])
--Edit: There's alternative 

2. Your server must have counter strike source mounted. Otherwise, some props, boss and faction loot caches
will be errors and you won't be able to hear some sounds since some sounds are from CS:S.

3. You need to create a config file for you map, this is literally as simple as going ingame and using these 3 commands:
ate_addzombiespawn - creates spawnpoints for the zombies to appear at
ate_addtrader - creates traders, you can type ate_refreshtraders to make them appear instantly
ate_addlootspawn - creates spawnpoints for the ingame loot caches, try to hide them well to give your players a challenge
ate_addairdropspawn - creates spawnpoints for the airdrops that appear, more airdrop spawnpoints mean more airdrop spawn locations to memorize
ate_addspawnpoint {name} - creates a spawn point where player can spawn in the position, if there are multiple player spawn points,
then the player will spawn at random location in one of the setup spawn points

if you mess something up you can use:
ate_clearzombiespawns
ate_cleartraderspawns
ate_clearlootspawns
ate_clearairdropspawns
ate_clearplayerspawnpoints

A better config setup system will most likely be added in future but for now it works well enough.
(it won't be added in the future, nor it was in the past, there are convars added already)


That's all!
If you have all of these above set up, it should be working.


===================================================================================

Adding custom content:
Adding your own items and weapons is as easy as it gets, all you need to do is edit 4 files within the gamemode root folder.

sh_items.lua - handles all ingame items, if you aren't sure what your doing then read over the existing items and see how they work.

sh_loot.lua - loot tables, determines what can be dropped from who or where

sh_spawnables.lua - controls which props and structures are available for players to build (some may be broken, some won't be able to be salvaged)

sh_config.lua - configurate max zombies, max loot and more

You can also edit the entire gamemode code if you are making your own version of the eternal apocalypsee

===================================================================================

Admin commands:

Admin commands are pretty rudimentary at the moment, expect better support for admins in future
Current commands are:

ate_sadmin_giveitem "name" "amount"          eg. ate_sadmin_giveitem item_rifleammo 3       - gives you the corresponding item
ate_sadmin_givecash "amount" - gives you cash moneys

ate_admin_clearzombies "force"  - deletes all regular zombies if force is false or not inputted,
deletes all nextbots including bosses if you type force after the command

ate_admin_spawnboss - triggers the spawnboss event regardless of player count
ate_admin_spawnairdrop - triggers the spawnairdrop event

To see more admin commands, see theeternalapocalypse/gamemode/server/admincmd.lua
